# emonHub

EmonHub is a piece of software running on the emonPi and emonBase that can read/subscribe or send/publish data to and from a multitude of services. It is primarily used as the bridge between the OpenEnergyMonitor monitoring hardware and the Emoncms software but it can also be used to read in data from a number of other sources, providing an easy way to interface with a wider range of sensors.
